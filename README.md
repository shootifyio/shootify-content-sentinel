## Overview

Shootify Content Sentinel is a blockchain-based content protection system designed to safeguard models' rights in AI-generated fashion photography. Built on the DFINITY/Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), the system provides robust on-chain content registration, real-time monitoring, and rights management. Its goal is to ensure that digital fashion content is registered immutably and that any unauthorized usage is detected and acted upon swiftly.

## Architecture

The project is structured into several interdependent components to ensure scalability, security, and performance:

- **Blockchain Layer:**  
  Leverages DFINITY/ICP for on-chain metadata storage and immutable fingerprinting of digital assets.

- **Backend Services:**  
  Developed primarily in Rust, these services handle secure hash generation, blockchain interactions, and the core business logic.

- **Frontend Dashboard:**  
  Built using Next.js, the dashboard offers models an intuitive interface to manage and monitor their content.
